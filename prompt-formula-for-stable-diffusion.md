# Prompt Formula for Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a software that uses AI to create images. To guide it to create the image you want, you can use positive and negative prompts. Positive prompts are words or phrases that tell the software what you want to see in the image, while negative prompts tell it what to avoid. 

Creating a good prompt is crucial. In fact, there are numerous websites where people seek ways to improve their prompt writing skills. This interest has given rise to a term called "prompt engineering.‚Äù

For the best results in generating images, a good prompt needs to include specific elements out of certain categories.

## Subject

The subject is what you want to see in the generated image. Ask yourself: do I want an image of a person? An animal or perhaps a landscape? 

For instance, let's focus on "a cat" as our subject.

Then, we need to consider the following questions:
- How do you characterize the cat? For instance, is the cat "adorable"?
- Are there particular characteristics you want for the cat? For example, the cat has "black fur and blue eyes."
- Where can the cat be found? For instance, "the cat is resting on a table."
- Are there any additional items the cat should have? For example, the cat is "wearing a red collar."

These questions collectively result in the following prompt formula:

```markdown
<Adjective> Subject <Action or Accessory> <Location>
```

- **Subject**: This is the central element you're addressing or emphasizing in your description. The subject can encompass a wide range of things, such as people, animals, objects, locations, plants, vehicles, food, weather conditions, natural occurrences, and abstract ideas.  It's the only mandatory part of the formula, so you must include it.
- **Adjective (Optional)**: You can use an adjective to add a descriptive word that helps paint a clearer picture of the subject. Adjectives can come before or after the Subject. This means you can use descriptive words to talk about the Subject, and you have the flexibility to place them before or after the main focus of your image.
- **Action or Accessory (Optional)**: This is where you can include an action or an item that's related to the subject, but it's not required.
- **Location (Optional)**: If you want to specify where the scene takes place, you can use this element. However, it's also optional.

In this formula:

- All the elements enclosed in angle brackets <...> are optional. This means you can choose whether or not to include them in your prompt.
- The only mandatory element is the Subject, so you must include it to describe the main focus of your image.
- The order of elements is not fixed, allowing you to place Adjectives, Actions or Accessories, and Locations before or after the Subject. This flexibility lets you craft your prompt in a way that best suits the context or your creative vision.
