# Overview of Stable Diffusion Models

## Where to find Stable Diffusion Models

The most popular places to find and download models are [Civitai(https://civitai.com/)] and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). Personally, I prefer Civitai because you can see examples of the images people generate with different models.

## How to use Stable Diffusion Models

1. Dowload the model according to the download instruction on the model page
2. To run the model, you will need a graphical user inteface (GUI). I recommend Stable Diffusion Web UI from Automatic 1111. You will find installation instructions [here](stable-diffusion-webui-installation-guide.md)


## Which Stable Diffusion Model is the Best?

There is no *best model*. There are different models for different purposes. Some models were trained on anime art, some on photographs, etc. For beginners, I recommend starting with [stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5). Once you mastered working with Stable Diffusion, you can move on to other models.
