Some popular example for artistic styles are:

Art in the romantic style is characterized by sharp contrast, bright highlights, strong colors, and a refined, almost
glossy finish.
- **Abstract art**: A focus on capturing the subject in its simplest form. Think of abstract
as a scale rather than an absolute term. Essentially all artworks have some form of abstraction. Its characteristics are Reliance on shapes, colors, lines, and contrast.
- **Impressionism**: Captures the artist's impression of a subject. It is recognizable by light colors, weak shadows, energetic brushwork, broken color, and colorful accents.
- **Photorealism**: It means capturing the subject with photographic accuracy. Photorealism is an art movement that seeks to replicate the look of real-life photographs through another medium. Charecteristics are meticulous drawing and detail.
- **Surrealism**: Surrealism is an art movement that explores the bizarre and dreamlike, creating images that defy reality and logic. It often features unexpected combinations, distorted forms, and a focus on the subconscious mind. Salvador Dalí and René Magritte are notable surrealistic artists.
- **Pop Art**: Pop art was a Western art movement that was popularized in The United States and Great Britain in the 1950s. Pop art – known for its bright, attention-catching colors – was used in advertising, merchandising, and graphic design during an era of rapid consumer growth.
- **Hyperrealism**: Hyperrealism is an art style that creates extremely realistic artworks, often indistinguishable from high-resolution photographs. Artists meticulously capture details to achieve a heightened level of realism.
